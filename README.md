# Öffi NG - Öffi Next Generation

This is a fork of **Öffi – The King of Public Transit!** from https://gitlab.com/oeffi/oeffi.

Öffi is an Android app that tells you where and when trains and busses go,
including delays and replacement bus service for more and more transport authorities in Europe and beyond.

**A lot of new features** have been added in this fork and continue to be added. Stay tuned!
See details in the [Wiki](https://github.com/santawho/oeffi-ng/wiki).

## Disclaimer

The current state of the project is "_continuous beta_". That means: be prepared for
unexpected results and behaviour, and frequent updates.

## Download, Install, Update

An easy way to download, install and periodically update _Öffi NG_
is using [Obtainium (get it here)](https://obtainium.imranr.dev/). Obtainium is similar to an alternative app store.
Alternatively, if you do not want to install and trust Obtainium, you can download Öffi NG manually
and then let the app itself periodically check for updates and guide you through the updating process.
